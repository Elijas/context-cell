# Bite 5: The Five-Stage Workflow

ACF structures all work into **five stages**:

```
PREPARE → SPECIFY → BUILD → VERIFY → HANDOFF
```

**What each stage means:**

1. **PREPARE** - Gather what you need
   - Collect context, read dependencies, understand requirements

2. **SPECIFY** - Define what success looks like
   - Write success criteria, define the harness (verification steps)

3. **BUILD** - Do the actual work
   - Write code, create documents, implement the solution

4. **VERIFY** - Prove it works
   - Run the harness, check outputs, validate results

5. **HANDOFF** - Close it out
   - Document final state, mark as complete, hand off to next person/agent

**The key insight:** You define **how to test** (stage 2) BEFORE you build (stage 3).

This prevents "I built something but don't know if it works" situations.
