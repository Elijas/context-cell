# Bite 2: What is the Agent Checkpoints Framework?

This is the **Agent Checkpoints Framework (ACF)** - a system for managing work done by humans AND AI agents.

## The Core Problem It Solves

When AI agents or humans work on complex tasks over time, things can go wrong:
- You forget what you were trying to do
- Work gets done but never verified
- Dependencies are unclear
- History is lost

## The Core Solution

The framework creates **CHECKPOINTS** - structured folders with specific files that document:
- What you're building
- Why you're building it
- What you've done so far
- Whether it's actually working

Think of it like a **recipe with quality checks built-in** - not just "add flour," but "add flour, then verify the texture is correct before proceeding."
