| Failure pattern               | Warning signs                                                                                                      | Detection tools                                                                                  | Required fix                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing harness               | MANIFEST lacks verification steps; LOG never records executed commands/tests                                       | Review MANIFEST; search for `TODO`, `pending`, or absence of `::THIS/ARTIFACTS` references       | Define the harness, execute it, and log the outcomes - or keep `VALID: false` until done.                                                                                |
| Stale contract                | STATUS or HARNESS describes intent that no longer matches outputs; LOG quiet despite ongoing changes               | Manual review; compare against `ARTIFACTS/`; `acft validate ::THIS --strict`                     | Flip `VALID` to false, refresh sections, add a LOG entry explaining the correction.                                                                                      |
| Missing MANIFEST LEDGER       | `VALID: true` but MANIFEST lacks a ledger or lists entries without rooted `::THIS/ARTIFACTS` paths                 | Frontmatter review; `acft manifest --mode quick`; `acft validate ::THIS`                         | Revert `VALID` to `false` or populate the ledger with real deliverables before closure; remove scratch assets from `ARTIFACTS/`.                                         |
| Unrooted references           | Bare paths, `../`, or shell-relative instructions                                                                  | `rg "::PROJECT"` absence, `rg "\.\./" -gCHECKPOINT.md`, human review                             | Rewrite references with `::PROJECT/`, `::WORK/`, or `::THIS/`; add line anchors where helpful.                                                                           |
| Relative-path bleed           | MANIFEST cited as `./ARTIFACTS/...` or upstream CHECKPOINTS linked with `../`; links break after moves             | `rg "\.\./" -gCHECKPOINT.md`; `rg "\./ARTIFACTS" -gCHECKPOINT.md`; code review                   | Replace with rooted paths (`::THIS/ARTIFACTS/...`, `::WORK/branch_v1_02/...`); rerun validation.                                                                         |
| Timeline gaps                 | Major decisions or command runs missing from LOG                                                                   | Compare commit history, STATUS edits, `ARTIFACTS/` timestamps                                    | Reconstruct events, add backdated LOG entries (with actual timestamps), and note why the correction was needed.                                                          |
| Orphaned successors/delegates | New CHECKPOINT exists but parent never references it; child lacks `DELEGATE_OF`                                    | `acft orient --descendants`; directory inspection                                                | Update parent LOG and MANIFEST with rooted links; update child frontmatter/LOG to close the loop.                                                                        |
| Version drift                 | Multiple active CHECKPOINTS share branch+version or restart failed to bump version                                 | `acft orient ::WORK --descendants`; naming audit                                                 | Bump the new effort to `_v{n+1}_{01}` or `v{m+1}_01`, document in both LOGs, archive superseded path if needed.                                                          |
| Scope shock                   | Stakeholder shifts scope midstream, leaving deliverables orphaned or assumptions invalid                           | LOG shows new directives; STATUS still reflects old plan; child CHECKPOINTS lack links to pivot  | Log the change with stakeholder source, capture superseded context in CONTEXT, and either adapt the CHECKPOINT's plan or open/retire CHECKPOINTS with clear cross-links. |
| History drift                 | Major context lives only in ancestor CHECKPOINTS or external docs, leaving current CHECKPOINT without enough recap | Successor CHECKPOINTS lack synopsis of prior decisions; new agents reread the entire work hierarchy | Include a "Context recap" block in STATUS summarizing inherited decisions with rooted links; reference prior LOG entries before making new decisions.                    |
| Dependency fog                | Work relies on sibling/parent deliverables without explicit contract                                               | MANIFEST references `../` paths without status; LOG lacks dependency checkpoints                 | Document each dependency with status (ready, pending, blocked) in MANIFEST, log when they change, and mark `VALID: false` until upstream is resolved.                    |
| Goal fog                      | Success criteria or exit conditions are undefined, causing wandering scope creep                                   | STATUS lacks clear objectives; LOG shows busy work without closure; HARNESS hard to write        | State measurable success criteria and exit conditions during PREPARE; update them as facts change, and log when criteria are met or redefined.                           |
| Validation theater            | `VALID: true` without a fresh harness run; LOG leans on "manual review" wording or unresolved blockers             | `rg "manual review"`; `rg "manual code review"`; absence of recent `HARNESS_EXECUTED` after `VALID` flip | Execute the harness or record a credible blocker contract (owner, target date, remediation link) and keep `VALID: false` until resolved.                                  |
