# Bite 1: The Big Picture

You have a directory called `spec` that contains **5 documents** defining a framework:

1. `FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATION.md` - The core concepts
2. `FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md` - The detailed specification
3. `CLI_REFERENCE.md` - Command-line interface reference
4. `FAILURE_CATALOGUE_TABLE.md` - List of possible failures
5. `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` - System instructions

This is a **specification for a framework** - documentation that explains how something works.

Think of it like an instruction manual for a system.
